**INTRODUCTION**
Alzheimer's Disease also called as Senile Dementia is a progressive disease that destroys memory and other important mental functions. It causes brain cells to degenerate and die. 
There'll be continuous decline in thinking, behavioral and social skills that disrupts a person's ability to function independently.The early signs of the disease may be forgetting recent events or conversations. As the disease progresses, a person with Alzheimer's disease will develop severe memory impairment and lose the ability to carry out everyday tasks.

**SYMPTOMS**
At first, a person with Alzheimer's disease may be aware of having difficulty with remembering things and organizing thoughts. A family member or friend may be more likely to notice how the symptoms worsen.
People with Alzheimer's may:

1. Repeat statements and questions over and over
2. Forget conversations, appointments or events, and not remember them later
3. Routinely misplace possessions, often putting them in illogical locations
4. Get lost in familiar places
5. Eventually forget the names of family members and everyday objects
