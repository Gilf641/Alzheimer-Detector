*INTRODUCTION**
Alzheimers Disease also called as Senile Dementia is a progressive disease that destroys memory and other important mental functions. It causes brain cells to degenerate and die. 
There'll be continuous decline in thinking, behavioral and social skills that disrupts a person's ability to function independently.The early signs of the disease may be forgetting recent events or conversations. As the disease progresses, a person with Alzheimer's disease will develop severe memory impairment and lose the ability to carry out everyday tasks.

**SYMPTOMS**
At first, a person with Alzheimer's disease may be aware of having difficulty with remembering things and organizing thoughts. A family member or friend may be more likely to notice how the symptoms worsen.
People with Alzheimer's may:

*     Repeat statements and questions over and over
*     Forget conversations, appointments or events, and not remember them later
*     Routinely misplace possessions, often putting them in illogical locations
*     Get lost in familiar places
*     Eventually forget the names of family members and everyday objects
